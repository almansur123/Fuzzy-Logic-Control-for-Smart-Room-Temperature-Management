# Fuzzy-Logic-Control-for-Smart-Room-Temperature-Management

This project demonstrates the design and simulation of a fuzzy logic temperature control system for smart rooms, using 2 inputs (temperature error and change in temperature) and 2 outputs (heater and fan power). The fuzzy controller employs 25 rules and triangular membership functions covering input ranges of ±10°C error and ±5°C/min rate of change, with output power levels scaled from 0 to 100%. Simulations in MATLAB validated system performance under scenarios such as heating from 15°C to 22°C and cooling from 28°C to 22°C, achieving target temperatures with minimal overshoot and smooth transitions. This approach addresses challenges of conventional PID controllers in nonlinear environments, delivering robust control with computational efficiency. Future enhancements aim to incorporate adaptive tuning to optimize performance dynamically, enabling up to 10–20% energy savings in smart HVAC applications.
